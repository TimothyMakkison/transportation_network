# transportation_network

This was the final programming assignnment for an Advanced Programming lab. Found [here.](https://github.com/k4io/lab-i-copy)

Given a collection of places and transportation links, calculate various values such as distance, the construction and vaidity of routes in a time efficient manner. 
Additional complexity is 

## Data
3 files were provided; [Places.csv](https://github.com/TimothyMakkison/transportation_network/blob/master/Places.csv) and [Links.csv](https://github.com/TimothyMakkison/transportation_network/blob/master/Links.csv) 
contained data to be constructed into the nodes and edges. [Commands.txt](https://github.com/TimothyMakkison/transportation_network/blob/master/Commands.txt) contains commands that must be read and performed.
